[With Citus, Algolia Speeds Up Search Analytics & Eradicates Database Management Headaches](https://www.citusdata.com/customers/algolia)

# tl;dr

1. Previous elasticsearch solution didn't handle huge traffic spike (~1B search operation by day), making it scale up wasn't impossible but required to much resource from Algolia at that time.

2. Look for scalability for new solution, rejected BigQuery of Google because of pricing model that make it hard to estimate cost and being too slow.

3. Redshift isn't a good option for doing sub-second aggregation regarding cost.

4. Clickhouse wasn't available on the cloud.

5. Citus allow to perform TopN and HyperLogLog operation on a distributed database via extension, a proof of concept was done with Citus team
> Benchmark tests showed that the Citus database would be capable of ingesting up to seven million rows per second.  
> Citus Cloud enables Algolia to ingest 5-10B rows per dayâ€”and growing.  
> Ninety-five percent of the queries made to our Citus database receive responses in less than 800 milliseconds.  

6. Only one cluster in the US now, plan to open another in Europe

7. Current process : raw events > aggregation job (5minutes) > rollup table > aggregation job (daily) > update rollup.  
So Citus store only the rollup, help speed up query and lower cost
