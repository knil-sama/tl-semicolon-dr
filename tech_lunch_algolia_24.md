Tech lunch 24 by Algolia on Developper advocacy

# tl;dr

## Speaker Valériane Venance, Deputy CTO at Le 24/24, Junior DevRel

+ Developper advocates are not so differents from evanglist

+ They make your product believable to a technical audience (in opposition to the Sales departement)
 
+ They talks mostly about and to, the Product, the dev team and community of users

## Speaker Laurent Doguin, VP Developer Relations at Clever Cloud

+ Developper advocate discuss with their audience (in opposition to evangelist that have a speech)

+ They are here to have a impact with people (dev team, users, futur trainee, etc), to do so they need to have a presence either online (blogging, open source contribution) or physical (training, talks, hackathon, feedback from conferences) so they tend to move a lot.

+ Too avoid burning out and maximise impact they should focus on the quality of their actions instead of the sheer numbers

+ It's also hard to try to measures concrete impact you have outside of the company (beer paid off can be a useful metric)

+ Don't necessarly specialize, more focus on curiosity and area of knowledge

+ Really try to etablish an connection with people and not to sale anything (tech person don't take the bait)

## Speaker Noël Macé, Developer Advocate at SFEIR 

+ Even if you don't have a product or a service to promote, like SFEIR that is a ESN you can focus on making your ecosystem better to help the company

+ Focus on the way they do thing by offering formations, blog post and open source contribution

+ You can help dev to avoid 3 main issue that : dev burnout, isolated dev recognition and dev boredout

# Afterword

I understand that this specific role is created for a people that at the junction of tech lead (good knowledge of product and dev organisation) and a spokesperson (great at public speaking, enthusiastic).
Some of the task can fit into a tech lead or a senior dev in the organization but at some scale you can't expect him/her to still doing all of this and programming.
You are not here to sold but to promote, what you promote is tied to your company and your own interests.
I am glad to saw another carrer path outside the classic pattern of tech lead or manager that often suggested for developper.
