Tech lunch 24 by Algolia on Developer advocacy

# tl;dr

## Speaker Valériane Venance, Deputy CTO at Le 24/24, Junior DevRel

+ Developer advocates are not so different from evanglists

+ They make your product believable to a technical audience (in opposition to the Sales department)
 
+ They talk mostly about and to, the Product, the dev team and community of users

## Speaker Laurent Doguin, VP Developer Relations at Clever Cloud [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zG6qNGxr5i4&index=2&list=PLuHdbqhRgWHIosfqQ-9whwXzN5sgY7NAk)

+ Developer advocate discuss with their audience (in opposition to evangelist that have a speech)

+ They are here to have an impact with people (dev team, users, future trainee, etc), to do so they need to have a presence either online (blogging, open source contribution) or physical (training, talks, hackathon, feedback from conferences) so they tend to move a lot

+ To avoid burning out and maximize the impact they should focus on the quality of their actions instead of the sheer numbers

+ It's also hard to try to measures concrete impact you have outside of the company (beer paid off can be a useful metric)

+ Don't necessarily specialize, more focus on curiosity and area of knowledge

+ Really try to establish a connection with people and not to sell anything (tech person don't take the bait)

## Speaker Noël Macé, Developer Advocate at SFEIR [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrmqjIR9GEk&list=PLuHdbqhRgWHIosfqQ-9whwXzN5sgY7NAk)

+ Even if you don't have a product or a service to promote, like SFEIR that is an ESN you can focus on making your ecosystem better to help the company

+ Focus on the way they do thing by offering formations, blog post, and open source contribution

+ You can help dev to avoid 3 main issue that: dev burnout, isolated dev recognition, and dev bored out

# Afterword

I understand that this specific role is created for a people that at the junction of tech lead (good knowledge of product and dev organization) and a spokesperson (great at public speaking, enthusiastic).  
Some of the tasks can fit into a tech lead or a senior dev in the organization but at some scale, you can't expect him/her to still do all of this and programming.  
You are not here to sell but to promote, what you promote is tied to your company and your own interests.  
I am glad to see another carreer path outside the classic pattern of tech lead or manager that are often suggested for developer
